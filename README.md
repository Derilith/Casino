This is the start of a fairly simple blackJack geme.
In order to start, you must pick how many decks you whish to choose from when swhitching between hands.
Next you must decide waether you will hit(drawing another card) by entering "H", stand(keeping the hand you have.) or quit the game, with "Q".
after this you can decide to continue playing, by entering "Y", or discontinue playing by entering "N".
